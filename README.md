# dna_tssuite

The DNA of every tssuite repo: one dependency that pulls in the whole set of topic layers.

Add this one layer and a repo gets the README structure, the guides, the index, the install guides, the VS Code settings, the clean code and test conventions, and the gg workflow.

## Layers

| Layer | What it brings |
| --- | --- |
| [dna_readme](https://github.com/ggdna/dna_readme) | README structure and templates |
| [dna_guides](https://github.com/ggdna/dna_guides) | developer and AI guides |
| [dna_translate](https://github.com/ggdna/dna_translate) | multi-language docs, de and en in sync |
| [dna_index](https://github.com/ggdna/dna_index) | index and navigation files |
| [dna_blog](https://github.com/ggdna/dna_blog) | blog format, templates, layout |
| [dna_install](https://github.com/ggdna/dna_install) | install guides: editor, node, Azure, tooling |
| [dna_vscode](https://github.com/ggdna/dna_vscode) | shared editor settings and extensions |
| [dna_clean_code](https://github.com/ggdna/dna_clean_code) | how code is written and tested, per language |
| [dna_gg](https://github.com/ggdna/dna_gg) | the gg workflow, and the scripts it calls |

This layer carries no files of its own — it exists to compose the ones
above. Everything a tssuite repo sees comes from them.


## Variables

- `dnaCopyrightHolder` — the name in the license header of every file,
  set to `tssuite` here

## Usage

Declare it as a dev-dependency and initialize once:

```bash
pnpm add -D @tssuite/dna-tssuite   # TypeScript projects
dart pub add dev:dna_tssuite     # Dart projects
gg dna init
```

The placed test instantiates and verifies the DNA on every test run.

## Development

The `dna/` folder is hand-authored source and is never generated. The repo
instantiates its own DNA — run `dart test` after changes; commit first, a
file the DNA would overwrite must not carry uncommitted work.
